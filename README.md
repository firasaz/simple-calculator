# simple-calculator
this is a simple calculator that i did while learning javascript. 
the html and css might be similar to another project posted here 
because i followed a youtube tutorial for the html and css part 
but the javascript code was written completely by me.

Synopsis:
  Calculator sticks to the rules of PEMDAS.
  Keyboard doesn't work for pressing on the calculator.

Installation:
  Download the file by clicking on code then downloading the zipped file on the directory of your preference.
  Unzip the file.
  Fire up the index.html file on any browser and you're good to go!
